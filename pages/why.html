        <h2>
            We should try to reduce gender inequality for a number of reasons. First, we can reduce the amount of poverty we see across the world and especially in developing countries.
            If women are equal to men in the workplace, then they have more support to be able to work and support the family outside of the household in a gender role typically reserved only for men.
            This type of gender equality has worked in the past. In Germany, once they streamlined the complaints and remedy processes, women were more encouraged to work as they were sure they
            would be able to get a solution for any problem they face in the workplace. Similarly in Kazakhstan, once they increased benefits to women, the number of people working for 8 hours a day
            increased and the second benefit of promoting gender equality becomes evident.

        <h2>
            Second, we can increase the productivity of our economy and even cover up the economic recession from the Covid-19 pandemic a few years ago. We all know about the Covid-19 pandemic and how
            the economy slowed due to the lockdown and how factory workers and other in person only workers were not able to go to work due to the pandemic. The economy of nearly every country across
            the world has still not recovered from this economic recession and by allowing women to work more and making it easier for them to put in more hours at work and not only limiting them
            to household work, we can cover up these losses from the pandemic and go to levels higher than before the Covid-19 pandemic.

        <h2>
            Third and perhaps one of the most important reasons why we should try to reduce gender inequality is to get a different perspective on the world’s problems. 
            Women, even if they live in the same household as men, have vastly different perspectives on the world, its culture, and its problems. The female perspective
            on some of the world’s most complicated problems has the potential to show the world that problems are easy to solve when the most talented and widest 
            perspectives are in charge of solving them.
